  <h1>Project Problems<h1>
      <p> The projects all around are a very bad place no matter what. Everyone wants to get out of there but dont have
        the money to do so. The living conditions inside of project building can some to be very terrible.</p>
      <p2> As stated in the text of New York Times The oven was on in Patricia Elcock‚Äôs apartment on the Lower East Side
        of Manhattan because the radiators were cold ‚Äî and a window in her 10-year-old grandson‚Äôs room would not close
        all the way. They had taped clear plastic over it, hoping the room would feel less drafty.

        ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold, it‚Äôs cold, it‚Äôs cold,‚Äù said Ms. Elcock, 59, a security guard who has lived in the building at 99-103
        Avenue C. for about 13 years. Other residents echoed her complaints about the heat ‚Äî off more than on lately,
        because the boilers seem to be in perpetual disrepair ‚Äî and about the slow response from the New York City
        Housing Authority, which runs the building.

        In the bone-chilling wake of a wind-propelled snowstorm, the city said that heating systems had failed in dozens
        of buildings operated by the agency and that repair crews were scrambling. Some 15,000 people, about one of
        every 11 living in agency buildings, did not have heat at some point during the storm.

        <h2> Project Violence
          <p style="color:blue;" VIOLENCE IN PROJECTS</p>
            <p3> VIOLENCE IN PROJECTS also have a big toll on the living conditions and why people want to leave so
              badly. This also put some project building in need of repairing. As stated in an article by daily news In
              a double dose of danger, some of the city's most crime-ridden housing projects are the same developments
              most in need of immediate repairs.
              At the Clinton Houses in East Harlem, the front door to a building hung wide open because of a broken
              spring. It provided a convenient escape for a young man in a blue Giants hoodie who sprinted through the
              doorway and up a staircase.
              A minute later, six cops rushed past a Daily News reporter through the same open door and into the lobby.
              Some dashed up the staircase. Some jumped into an elevator and raced to the top. Witnesses saw the young
              man trying to steal a car, and the wide-open busted door allowed an escape. The suspect got away. The are
              also lots of rodents that can be very disturbibing to people and can carry diseases. but thats a different
              topic but i will have photos of this on my instagram link belowü§ìüßêü§ì
