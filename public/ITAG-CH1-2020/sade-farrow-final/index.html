<h1>PROBLEM STATMENT:</h1>
<p>We live in an time period  where the racial divide is growing. Tensions are further provoked by repeated  news coverage and viral videos that are being uploaded and shared across all social media outlets: anti-political corrective rhetoric,the burning of the American flag, the killing of black men by police, both justified and unjustified, and the list goes on and on to this day . Black children are in danger ,black me and women are in danger the walk around everyday afraid that today would be there last day all because of the color of there skin that they were born with. </p><h1>GOALS:</h1><p>The whole point of creating this website and gathering my community together is because we have made it to 2020 and there is still a on going issue with police bruitality,white supremacy and unjustice law systems. In this point of time us people are fed up with the on going inequality and rasism by our fellow citizens ,this website is here for indivisuals who are lost on why people look at us as a threat other then who we really are ,my goal is too widen my audience to other races and expand there knowledge on blakc history and african american culture so we can teach them that we are all the same dosent matter the color of your skins </p>

<h1>STATISTICS</h1> <p>some statistics surrounded around the whole culture and race of african americans are that Students of color face harsher punishments in school than their white peers, leading to a higher number of youth of color incarcerated. Black and Hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in school-related arrests or referrals to law enforcement. Currently, African Americans make up two-fifths and Hispanics one-fifth of confined youth today.another one is that one in three black men can expect to go to prison in their lifetime. Individuals of color have a disproportionate number of encounters with law enforcement, indicating that racial profiling continues to be a problem.these statistics that have been flooting around for decads were created to down grade the black community. <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/iEp18Hy5wbG5LW80hN/giphy.gif"height="400px"></p> <h1>SOLUTIONS TO END POLICE BRUITALITY</h1><p>1.End Policing of Minor "Broken Windows" Offenses.including Consumption of Alcohol on Streets
