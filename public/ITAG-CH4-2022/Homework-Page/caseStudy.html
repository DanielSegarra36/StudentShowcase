Most food systems fail as there are specific guideline that must be followed. According to the ‘Sustainable Development Goals’, to work affectively and benefit all involved in the food system, it must meet environmental, social, and economic suitability. The goal is having a close loop system where all output is recycled and the least amount of input is required for it to function. You must also keep in mind to plan for the fringe cost and legal fees to operate the business. Most commercial farms use government subsidies and illegal workers to offset cost.
