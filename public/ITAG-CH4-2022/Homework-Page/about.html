        <h3 class="Heading2"> Green roof and solar construction permitting specialist <br>and now espiring web developer
          and city girl farmer.</br></h3>

        <p> I studied accounting and business administration and worked in the corporate and nonprofit sector for 8
          years. During the course of my career, I managed to accrue years of work experience. Most notably: </p>

        <div class="Job-history">

        <p> Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven management,
          analytical, and service skills, which I hope to leverage on all future endeavors. </p>
