					<h2> Hi! My name is Rimi. </h2>
					<p>
						On July of 2022 I joined an agriculture and tech program provided by The Urban Wild where we focused on soilless farming. During this course we learned about hydroponics, how to set up our own systems and how to utilize tech, such as IOT, to better monitor our farms.
					<p>Once we met the conditions, we were given a stipend of $750. The first $500 was for materials for our farm builds and the remainder was left for any upgrades and maintenance cost.
					</p>
					<p>These last 10-weeks were intense but fun, and even though there were a few challenges</p>
					<p>
						life is full of pastabilities. Follow me on my journey navigating through my small NYC apartment and growing everything I need to make pasta!
