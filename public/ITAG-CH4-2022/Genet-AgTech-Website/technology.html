      <h1>Starting Out</h1>
     <p> Now, where do I begin with technology. All I can say is the range of emotions I went through coding this page in general was… Wow. But I see how rewarding it is. I knew coming into this program technology would be my weaker suit but a open mind is what kept me going. Learning how to code my own page did open my perspective with user interface design. I really took my time designing this page to feel more personable.  </p>
      <h1> Applying Technology to my System</h1>
      <p> So the plan was to be able to connect sensors to my system in order to monitor temperature, humidity and pH balance. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to connect my sensors due to my laptop using an outdated operating system. (We have to keep in mind when incorporating technology in agriculture the technology has to be up-to-date! Outdated technology can result in inaccurate readings or not being able to read data at all.) But the show must go on! With a handy-dandy pH meter and three in one temp,time,humidity clock I already had, I still had the ability to receive this information. Instead of using the senses to input this data into an app I manually created a table in order to check this information myself. I will check all levels three times a week around the same time during the day in order to get the most accurate reading. I also was able to incorporate API into this page to see the current weather as well. I wanted to be able to see how the difference in temperature compared to my house.</p>
      <h1> Conclusion </h1>
      <p> As I continue to work on the system, I will update how the charting is going. Of course, the update of the technology (laptop) will be in the works as well. For now here's a video of me doing my knight rider homework and getting it right. </p>
