        <h1>Who is Genét</h1>
        <p>A New York native with a passion for healing and educating through nature and city pizazz. Born in Harlem,
          Genét took in her environment by immersing herself into the hustle and bustle of the city while enjoying the
          subtle presence of nature. Her love for nature took her into the holistic path of herbalism and gardening.
          While
          she currently explores Birthwork, Genét found <a style="text-decoration:none; color: #f76c26"
            href="https://www.changefoodforgood.org/">The Urban Wild's</a> AgTech program and decided to immerse herself
          into learning about agriculture, technology and construction. </p>
        <h2>Genét Career Goals</h2>
        <p>As she continues to broaden her horizons in soil-less food systems, Genet will design and construct more
          hydroponic systems. From the crops that she grows with these systems, she wishs to curate community food boxes
          to provide to anyone who suffers from food security. People should not be without food, when community exists!
          Her lifetime goal is to be able to have three functioning sustainable food systems in at-least three states.
