      <h1>Starting Out</h1>
     <p> I have a steady background in urban gardening but didn't have any clue about soil-less systems yet alone hydroponic ones. However, I was always adamant about growing bell peppers because they are so expensive! I wanted to build a system that would best support the crop once it began to grow and become heavy. </p>
      <h1> Finding Inspiration</h1>
      <p> Taking my talents to YouTube, I found <a style = "text-decoration:none; color: #fbf642" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFxdiwy5rU7DBfQT6wnDm0A/videos?view=0&sort=p&shelf_id=2">Tikki O's page</a>  where she enjoys growing crops hydroponically. She had a <a style = "text-decoration:none; color: #fbf642" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq1YcONxNkw">video</a> on growing bell peppers hydroponically using a Deep Water Culture method and Kratky method. She wanted to see what system will produce the better crop. Already interested in DWC, I decided that I would grow my crops in that system. Deep Water Culture hydroponics is actually one of the most simple systems. The crop grows in a net pot filled with clay pebbles while the roots are immersed in nutrient solution water that is oxygenated by an air pump. </p>
      <h1>Need's Assessment</h1>
      <p> Thanks to the handy-dandy needs assessment I  was able to figure out what limitations I might face when building out my system. Since I currently live in Public Housing I am more prone to blackouts. This could effect my crops since I plan on solely using grow lights. I live by the train and have animals in my house so air pollutants and pet dander would be another concern. Lastly, since I have pets (especially the cats) I didn't want them to eat my crops. If I had the ability to I would of put my system in my bedroom but I wanted my system to be as close to the kitchen as possible so I would have quicker access to the filtered water.</p>
      <h2> How do I Plan On Mitigating these Issues </h2>
      <ul> 
        <li>Electrical hazard: I have a back up generator that can be used. If my generator doesn't work I also get at least four hours of sunlight where my system is located.</li> 
        <li>Air pollutants: I can keep the grow tent closed and have an air purifier nearby in order to avoid pet dander getting on the crops.</li> 
        <li>Pet exposure: Since the cats like to scratch my grow tent, I can cover their go-to areas with aluminum foil.</li></ul>
    
  <h1>Bell Peppers?</h1>
  <p> I really enjoy Bell Peppers. They can go on anything, you can cook them anyway and you can eat them raw! The Carnival Blend I chose produces all different colors of Bell Peppers. I knew the challenges with growing this crop is that I would have to pollinate myself and also accomodate them once they start becoming heavy. With that in mind, I plan to use to use an electric toothbrush to hand pollinate and weigh down the net cups with barbells.</p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>My seeds just start sprouting so they are taking their time to marinate in some nutrient solution water before they peak out the rockwool. I only expect to have two plants that produce a couple of bell peppers.The yield should atleast support a family of four.</p>
