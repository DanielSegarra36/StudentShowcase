  Smart agriculture is just getting underway and involves exploiting data from many sources â€“ sensors on farm equipment and plants, satellite images and weather tracking. The use of water and fertilizers will be measured and monitored in detail sometimes on plant by plant basis.
  </p> 
<p>The IoT is set to push the future of farming to the next level. Smart agriculture is already becoming more commonplace among farmers, and high-tech farming is quickly becoming the standard thanks to agricultural drones and sensors.
</p>
 IoT sensors report weather conditions and monitor soil moisture and acidity while animal farmers track the movement and behavior of livestock remotely via embedded devices. Industrial IoT applications are also useful for monitoring indoor agricultural facilities such as silos, dairies and stables.
<p>
IoT agriculture application areas include farm vehicle tracking, livestock monitoring, large and small field farming, and storage monitoring. Drones have become an invaluable tool for farmers to survey their lands and generate crop data.
