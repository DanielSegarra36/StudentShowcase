  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>Hilal Ersal-Intro to AG Tech Student</h2>
    <p> My name is Hilal and I have a MA degree in psychology from Pace University. While studying, I assisted my professor with the transcription of the interviews of participants. In addition to data collection and management, I handled the recruitment, screening, and scheduling. </p>
      <p> I have always interested in growing vegetables and have been doing it for a while. Over the past years, I have became increasingly passionate about food security and economic inequality that led me to work at NGO Rebuilding Together. I was an AmeriCorps member and some of my responsibilities were to visit low-income families, help to fix their window frames, damaged floors and doors, and maintain their gardens and green spaces. Iâ€™ve learned to use hand and power tools to assist my supervisor on our home and community garden visits. Working there was a rewarding experience for me.</p>
      <p> I enjoy being out in the nature, hiking with my family and take good care of my plants. Some of my future goals are finishing my ITAG training succesfully and start working as an urban farmer to grow more food to support our communities and low income families.
