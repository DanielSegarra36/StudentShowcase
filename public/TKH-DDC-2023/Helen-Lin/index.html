        <h2>Aviation High School:<h2>
            <p></p>
            <h4>Founded in 1936, Aviation Career and Technical Education High School is a CTE school that is certified
              by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) whichtrains students to become Aviation Maintenance
              Technicians (AMTS) via preparation to take the Airframe of Powerplant Qualifying Tests. Every day,
              students spend 3 to 4 periods in a hangar designed room. This class is called "shop". Students have
              rotations which introduce them to topics in the FAA-H-8083-30A textbook. Through these shop classes, which
              are usually taught by A&P certified alumni of the school, students become famirliarized with the textbook
              information and the mechanical practices of maintaining aircrafts and their components. By completing the
              4 or optional 5 years of shop, students are able to test for their licenses. </h4>

            <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
            <p></p>
            <h4>In my free time, I enjoy being by myself. During this time, I usually watch YouTube videos or study for
              the SAT. When I'm with friends, I enjoy sports, specifically volleyball and iceskating. Some of my other
              hobbies include baking and browsing Twitter. Although I value my solidarity, I enjoy spending time with my
              friends. Whwn we spend time together, we go on picnics and to museums, mainly because they want photos.
