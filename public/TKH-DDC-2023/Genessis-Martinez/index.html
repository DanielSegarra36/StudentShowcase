<p> I am a beginner in coding; I discovered coding through social media and loved how much creativity it allowed. Other than coding I love to read and am always looking for good book recommendations. In my free time I love going to concerts it's one of my new interests. In the future I really would love to find a way to incorporate film and computer science. My interest in film is due to my school they show us all the skills needed such as screenwriting, directing, and editing.</p>
