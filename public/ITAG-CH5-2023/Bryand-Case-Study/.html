          What Problem Is Being Addressed?
        </h1>
        <p>The problem that is being addressed is how can we grow our own food at home and the shortage of plants and
          vegetables that is happening globally,due to global warming and the temperature getting hotter it is affecting
          the way we grow our plants.According to
          <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/us-grocery-shortages-deepen-pandemic-dries-supplies-2022-01-14/">article
          </a>it states
          "In the U.S., recent snow and ice storms that snared traffic for hours along the East Coast also hampered food
          deliveries bound for grocery stores and distribution hubs. Those delays rippled across the country, delaying
          shipment on fruit and vegetables with a limited shelf life while growers with perishable produce are forced to
          pay inflated shipping rates to attract limited trucking supplies"

            The context of this report is to create and explain in detail my home farm system, and what prompted this
            report is how did i gather all the information to create and desgin my own home farm system.The background
            is
            which steps i will be taking in order to complete my project and how will i be desinging and manging my own

            <p>
              The problem is how do we create our home farm system at home and how to we combat the problem of shortage
              of
              vegtables all around the world.I believe the problem is we have to much issues going on with global
              warming
              and how it is affecting our ecosystem and how we gain access to our plants and fresh vegetables all over
              the
              world.

                    Factors that should be considered in developing a recommendation is to listen to the feedback that
                    i recevied to develop a recommendation because listening to the pros and cons can make me write a
                    recommendation.

                        The way i will support my recommedations in my report is by using the feedback i recieve from

                          right equipment and it will be difficult to maintain a system is a small amount of time and
                          also not being around it all of the time.
