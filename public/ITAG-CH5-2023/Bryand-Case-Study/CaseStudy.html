          and my research, it is also a guide for a beginningers to read and understand how i created the home farm system and what things that i did to create a working home farm system

          What Problem Is Being Addressed?
        </h1>
        <p>The problem that is being addressed is how can we grow our own food at home, and the shortage of plants and
          vegetables that is happening globally due to global warming.The temperature getting hotter is affecting
          the way we grow our plants.According to
          <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/us-grocery-shortages-deepen-pandemic-dries-supplies-2022-01-14/">article
          </a>it states
          "In the U.S., recent snow and ice storms that snared traffic for hours along the East Coast also hampered food
          deliveries bound for grocery stores and distribution hubs. Those delays rippled across the country, delaying
          shipment on fruit and vegetables with a limited shelf life while growers with perishable produce are forced to
          pay inflated shipping rates to attract limited trucking supplies"This infortmation shows that in the world there are many issues that we cannot predict and that it is getting worse.

            The context of this report is to create and explain in detail my home farm system, and what prompted this
            report and how did i gather all the information to create and desgin my own home farm system.The first things you will need is desinging such as a 2d and 3d model of your system, and then what youll need next is the materials as well as the crop that you want to grow.

            <p>
              The problem is how do we create our home farm system at home and how to we combat the problem of shortage
              of
              vegtables all around the world.I believe the problem is we have to much issues going on with global
              warming
              and how it is affecting our ecosystem and how we gain access to our plants and fresh vegetables all over
              the

                    Factors that should be considered in developing a recommendation is to listen to the feedback that you receive also you have to,develop a recommendation.It's important because listening to the pros and cons can help you alot into making a recommendation a example can be like changing the growth tent to match the home farm system or finding another crop that can grow in your home.

                    <p>
                      The recommendations I am making are moving the home farm system to a bigger space like my living room bc it has 55 inches of free space.I made sure that I have easy access to the outlets and making
                      sure i have filetered water and a spray nozzle as well as a drain line.The reasons i am making these recommedations is because i have to change how i will set it up because of hazards and things that can happen as well as do i need these things for my home farm system.

                      <p>
                        The way i will support my recommedations in my report is by using the feedback i recieve from
                        my instructor and maing sure that i am using the right tools.To help maintain and grow the
                        home grown farm system.Also i plan to distrubute the plants that i make i believe if i can
                        reach as people as possible it can be more helpful.

                          right equipment and it will be difficult to maintain a system is a small amount of time and
                          also not being around it all of the time.

                                  dont have enough space for it and maybe it can be a hazard to my cat if she tries to
                                  jump in it.Also i am not sure if i have the right sizes and it can be difficult to
                                  have a resviror/pump that does not work the 55 gallon barrel.Also working and installing the home farm system was a bit difficult because although i created it in my 2D and 3D model it looks completely different in person.
